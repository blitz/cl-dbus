This library aims to be an implementation of the D-BUS specification.

* Introduction

If you don't want to hack on this, you can stop reading at this point
and delete the directory containing this file.

Okay, you are still here.

* Development resources

The official source code repository of this project is managed in
git. To get a copy of the recent development tree, visit:

 http://github.com/blitz/cl-dbus

There is currently no fancy project page, bug tracker or
whatever. Please coordinate your effort with js at alien8 dot de or
use github's communication methods to reach me.

* Some notes

** Implementation-specific code

An effort has been made to include no implementation-specific code,
but to rely on various wrapper libraries. This increases the amount of
dependencies somewhat, but frees CL-DBUS from a lot of clutter.

** Endianness

Due to simplicity I plan only to support host endianness for outgoing
messages, i.e. every message we compose ourselves. Incoming messages
should be parsable regardless of their endianness.
